# TicTacToe-Series
Programs in my attempt to create a tic tac toe program.
Took two tries over a long period of time, returned with more programming knowledge on classes and implemented it for efficiency.
TicTacToe.py is the first attempt, Independent OOP Project is the second and successful attempt with better efficiency.
The first attmept was almost successful but was lacking efficieny in the code and the win condition was not working. The second attempt is more refined with a similar aesthetic but a working win condition and multiple extra features.
